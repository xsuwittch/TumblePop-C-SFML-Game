# TumblePop — C++ SFML Game

TumblePop is a 2D arcade-style game made in C++ using the SFML library.  
I built this project with my friends for a university assignment.

The game includes player movement, enemies, basic animations, collisions, and different assets (textures, maps, etc.) loaded from external files.
